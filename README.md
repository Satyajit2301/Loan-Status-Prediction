# Loan-Status-Prediction
This project builds a machine learning model using Support Vector Machines that does just that! Using historical data of past applicants, we trained our model to understand patterns and predict whether a new applicant will be approved or not.



## 📚 What We Did:
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset 🧹
- Visualized the data 📊
- Converted categories to numbers 🔢
- Trained an SVM model 🤖
- Tested it and checked accuracy 🎯
- Created a mini prediction system 🧠

## 🔧 Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn (for charts)
- Scikit-learn (for model training)

## 🏁 Results
The model shows promising accuracy on both training and test data, making it a useful tool for quick loan predictions.

## 💡 Want to Try?
Run this notebook locally or on Google Colab, play around with the input values in the prediction function, and see how changes affect approval chances!
